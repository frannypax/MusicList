# MusicList
my music collection

Some general insights...
1. committing : saves what you have done but does only keeps it in your local hdd and not the repo.

2. Express: A node js based web server.
3. You need to install an express generator to save time writing so much code.
3.a. yarn global add express-generator
3.b. then do "express -v ejs -f musiclist" ( Means install express, with ejs as the view engine into the musiclist folder by force (that's why the -f))
4. By degault, express uses jade as a view engine. jade has now been changed to pug. We are using ejs here.

5. Routing
